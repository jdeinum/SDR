How to synchonrize the SDR with the tcpdump output?


1. Send a custom probe request that we could see on both the SDR output and
   tcpdump

2. Send a message from gnuradio right before it begins capturing using sockets

3. Use a widget, and close the widget when we are ready to scan. This is the
   only working solution I have, but it is the least reliable.

4. RFTap?
