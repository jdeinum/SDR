# Rooting Androids


## The Goal
Find a method that can reliably root several different kinds of Android phones
without needing manual tweaking.


## Kingo
Kingo is an app that one can install on the phone to do the rooting process for
them. There is next to no transparency on what it does at all (classic). But it
seems to have a fairly high success rate on reddit. While it seems successful,
we must remind ourselves that there is a possibility that the phones may get
bricked. Since most of the Androids are old, we don't care if one or two of them
die.

## Installation

1. Make sure you are allowed to download from unknown sources
2. Download the APK from [here](https://www.kingoapp.com/)
3. Click on the downloaded file to install it
4. Once the app is installed, just click on the app to root your phone.



## Testing
To see how effective the app is, I'll be rooting 5 different android phones and
seeing what percentage of them end up with the su binary.
