A list of other works and some things I found interesting.

- WPS sections list more data around the device making it easier to identify
- WPS section contains the UUID-E which is based on the devices universal MAC
- WPS is only really used by devices without a screen like printers... so not
  really that useful


  address which does not change. (you can even reverse engineer the uuide to the
  original universal MAC address)
- Supported transfer rates, vendor information, sequence numbers, interarrival
  times
- MAC addresses are only changed for each scan (which is done according to the
  android scan plan)
- If sequence numbers are not random, we expect the sequence numbers to be
  around the same value.

-  We could use a honeypot attack to get a device to give away its real MAC

- could use carrier offset to uniquely identify devices

- Can send CTS messages to a devices "Real" MAC address. If it is the correct
  address then they will receive a CTS. The problem here is that we need to
  probe the correct address, and well, what are the odds of getting the right
  one? How do we know which address to associate the given CTS response with?





How about a system that uses all of the following:
- Checks if MAC randomization if even used
- Carrier Frequency Offset 
- Sequence Number
- Preferred Network List
- Supported Transfer Rates
- Vendor Information
- Inter-Arrival Times
